# Angular2-SpringBoot-Example

Integrating Angular2 frontend with SpringBoot backend

The purpose of this project is to provide a documented and easily understandable way to connect an Angular2 frontend UI with a SpringBoot powered backend. I've searched Google and all the examples I found required Maven plugins and configuration, which I found messy. Most of the examples tried to have the frontend and backend run on the same server, but convention is to have them run on separate servers.

This app will only be configured to run on local machines.

CURRENT STATUS: IN-PROGRESS
